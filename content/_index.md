Hi I am Varun..

i could leave my intro at that, but since i hate leaving things empty here is what is to be noted about me

My name is Varun.V, As mentioned in my repo, i hail from ernakulam, specificaly tripunithura...i like to make dark jokes(only with people who i am sure can handle them... things get too dark too fast)...i like to spend a lot of my time watching netflix(as we all do unfortunately(or fortunately)) and listening to music(dont ask genre )...I absolutely adore doing Model UN's(with a same burning passion as i reserve for coding)..that is pretty much it, i guess, as You cant sum up a person in a paragraph but still you get the gist right...

Previous Projects:-  

AI

I have done on project in connection with a workshop organized but Intel called AI4YOUTH. It consisted of two phases... one was to learn how to make AI including chatbots, trying out nueral networks etc.

The second phase was a project called tweet classifier/ Sentiment classifier. as the name suggests its used to analyse tweets for better filtering of your twitter feed(oh sorry X). This was a mentor-mentee kind of program.

Game Dev

I have made games in unity(haven't published any)...the largest project i worked on was to make a Maze Runner game that was to be integrated into our schoolstech fest.

Python

I've done projects mostly based on tkinter...i dont know if i can technically call this mine but just to add...my school project at the end of 12th was a social media search engine- you input a person or organisation and it webscrapes the google results, returns the top results and then it displays only social media links

My main projects(Unfinished as well) are already listed in my github page

my other social media pages are a joke so i am only available in the following:-
