Hugo, hugo, hugo.... üòí->üòÅ is what i would describe My journery through the "Wonderous" world of hugo as.... i did the task twice and it has been a headache but right now as i am typing this, the entire thing seems so easy and clean like dammmnnn....this is all you gotta do to get a blog up and running..... anyways i'll talk about both attempts seperately

___________________________________________________________________
## Attempt-1

I started by looking up what hugo is then  browsing thrugh their site, lookin' at themes and then looked up how to set up hugo and making blogs with it.e..
i followed two vids actually (technically 1 since one of it is a large playlist):-

i started this till tut-8(archetypes) i believe... the only reason i started was coz he was installing it in windows and i wanted to try out hugo in windows too..he explained it nycc but was very slow

I followed this guy then for a bit of time... i made a website from this but still had some issues that i had to work on so i restarted from scratch

## Attempt-2

I remade the needed repositories and started working on hugo

this time i used the official website to learn how to do... this time it works real fine...

[Hugo Official introduction](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

this site led me through the basics and perfected my idea of how to use hugo and to utilise it to its maximum potential(or as much as i could have learned in the short span of time)
